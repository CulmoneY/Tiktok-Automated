Video Editor

This module is responsible for processing movie clips. It segments a given movie clip into parts,
each lasting 61 seconds. Each clip is then enhanced with subtitles and a part number.
A watermark is also added to each clip. The processed clips are saved as mp4 files in a specified folder.
